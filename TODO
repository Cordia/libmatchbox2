Things Tuomas is asking for:

 Rh1 Opacity in compositing.  This is soundly broken.
 Rh2 Is it using Over where it shouldn't?       -- no
 Rh3 Menus-- they shouldn't have back buttons   -- this is Rh1
 Rh4 Theming dialogues.  See ImageViewer and Control Panel.
 Rh5 Rounded corners.                           -- this is Rh1
 Rh6 Window titles should always be left-justified
      -- done
 Rh7 Dialogs should have titlebars
      -- they do; they're just currently 3px high


---------------------------------------------------------------

In no particular order
===

 - Support missing client window props including specific mb ones (later)
   + add tracking of these props changing with some kind of signals
     (so clients types can use them)

 - Simple signal mechanism for MBObject ?

 - Add an extras/ dir adding optional support for;
   + XSettings
   + Startup Notification
   + Composite ?
  (both can hook into X event callbacks via an init function. Needs
   thought on how further integration can work) (MA)

 - Basic theme engine with working buttons. (MA)
   + Add matchbox-window-manager simple implementation.

 - Render picture support loading from PNG's, inline data (MA)
 
 - better event loop with arbituary add_timeout(msecs, callback) style
   support.
   + this will then allow support for _NET_WM_PING proto.
   + event calls should be modular enough to hook into glib main loop.

 - Improve client types, add an input window type. 

 - Image based theme engine - takes a single 'template' image and conf file
   build Maemo like theme from this.

 - Dialog dragging (+resizing?)
